Data Transformation and Population Analysis (Power BI)

Overview:

This task involves the integration of economic and population data to enable an in-depth analysis of global population trends. The data undergoes various transformations, including handling missing values and merging datasets. An interactive dashboard is created using Power BI to visualize global population trends from 1960 to 2050.

Key Steps:

Uploading and transforming datasets to integrate population and economic data.
Cleaning and imputing missing values in the datasets to ensure consistency.
Establishing relationships between economy and population data to enable deeper analysis.
Building and explaining an interactive Power BI dashboard, showcasing various population metrics like population growth, life expectancy, and urban vs. rural populations.
